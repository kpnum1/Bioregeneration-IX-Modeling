# Bioregeneration-IX-Modeling

This repo has code associated with the following journal article: 

"Aponte-Morales, V. E., Payne, K. A., Cunningham, J. A., & Ergas, S. J. (2018). Bioregeneration of 
chabazite during nitrification of centrate from anaerobically digested livestock waste: experimental 
and modeling studies. Environmental science & technology, 52(7), 4090-4098."

The Matlab script Bioregen_model.m implements a homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM)
which predicts the kinetics of IX between NH4+ and Na+
The biological process is a two-step nitrification process
described by an Andrew's model to account for inhibition 

The solution of the differential equations is a finite difference method
& the plots are for a bioreactor amended with chabazite
