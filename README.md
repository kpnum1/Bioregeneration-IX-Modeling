# Bioregeneration-IX-Modeling

This repo has code associated with the following journal article: 

Aponte-Morales, V. E., Payne, K. A., Cunningham, J. A., & Ergas, S. J. (2018). Bioregeneration of 
chabazite during nitrification of centrate from anaerobically digested livestock waste: experimental 
and modeling studies. Environmental science & technology, 52(7), 4090-4098.

The Matlab script IX_model implements a homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM)
which predicts the kinetics of IX between NH4+ and Na+
The solution of the differential equation is a finite difference method
